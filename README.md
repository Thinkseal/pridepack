# PridePack
This is PridePack. A Resource Pack made by [Pridecraft Studios](https://github.com/pridecraft-studios). We make Minecraft queer.
We also have compatibility with some mods, such as [Paladin's Furniture Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/paladins-furniture). If you want to see your  or any other mod be gayed without making it look like all flat rainbows, create an [Issue](https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios/pridepack-modded/issues/new) on GitHub detailing your suggestion. New mods will go to Pridepack Modded.
## Who

We're working on [PridePack](https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios/PridePack), [PrideMod](https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios/PrideMod), and many other [projects](https://github.com/orgs/Pridecraft-Studios/repositories).

## What mods are currently supported?
Currently, the only themed mod is [Paladin's Furniture Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/paladins-furniture), which is avaliable on the base Pridepack resource pack.
We plan adding support for the [Create Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/create), [More Axolotl Variants Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/mavm) (*could be added to Pridemod instead*), [Botania](https://modrinth.com/mod/botania) (gay tater :thonk:) and many other mods we get suggestions for
